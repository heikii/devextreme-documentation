##### shortDescription
Specifies series elements to be highlighted when a user points to the series.

---
When a user points to the series, it may react in one of the following ways depending on the value of the **hoverMode** option.

* **nearestPoint**   
The series changes its style along with the point that is nearest to the cursor.
* **includePoints**   
The series changes its style along with all the points.
* **excludePoints**   
The series changes its style, but the points do not.
* **none**   
The series does not react to pointing to it.

[note]Points in area series are hidden by default. To make them visible, assign **true** to the **point**.**visible** option.

#include common-ref-enum with {
    enum: "`ChartSeriesHoverMode`",
    values: "`NearestPoint`, `IncludePoints`, `ExcludePoints`, and `None`"
} Note that although this enum accepts more values, only the listed ones can be applied to an area series.
